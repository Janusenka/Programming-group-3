#Bruce Willis' average revenue is approximately 255.7 million USD while the overall average movie revenue is approximately 82.7 milliom USD.
#Therefore, Bruce Willis' movies average revenue lies above the whole average movie revenue.

#The law of large numbers implies that when we take a large number of observations, the sample average will be close to the true population average.
#However when the number of observations is small, the average may be misleading.  
#Since Bruce Willis only has 9 movies, which is relatively a small sample, the average revenue might not be a trustworthy estimate of how his movies typically perform in the broader population.
#The conclusion in 2b is not fully trustworthy, because Bruce Willis appears in only 9 movies in the dataset. 
#According to the law of large numbers, the reliability of an average increases with the number of observations. 
#With such a small sample, a few unusually high-grossing movies can strongly influence the average, making the result less representative of his true performance across all movies.
